            My second stop was a Chateau in the Loire valley named Bel Ebat. It was owned by Jeff 
            and Oscar, a gay couple with three boys, who had lived in America and London before 
            settling in France. Jeff collected me from the train station in the nearby town of Chinon 
            and we drove through blazing sunshine to the Chateau. The Bel Ebat estate was nestled 
            behind a stone wall across the road from a small vineyard. Scattered around the estate 
            were several other buildings, four of which had been converted into guesthouses; a small
             cottage, a gatehouse overlooking the vineyard, and two barns. Each was a self-contained
              unit, with the interiors pristinely designed by Oscar, who welcomed me on arrival.
The estate had an interesting history, including a fire at the Chateau many years before, suspected
 to be an intentional arson attack by the former owner seeking an insurance payout. The subsequent
  owner had attempted to restore the building, ran out of cash and was forced to hand the estate over
   to the stonemasons who had been working on it. The building&apos;s exterior had been restored before it 
   was then sold to Jeff and Oscar, but the interior remained unfinished. English was the first 
   language at Bel Ebat; the kids spoke English and French, Oscar spoke Spanish, English and French 
   and Jeff was American.
The first evening, Oscar cooked pizzas on an outdoor stove and we ate at a long table set out under a 
red maple tree. Three of the guesthouses were occupied at this point and we were joined by a Parisian 
family and an American couple who lived in Buenos Aires. Whilst the kids swung around in the tree, the 
grown-ups chatted around the table, and I found myself talking to one of the guests; a big Texan guy 
called Chris who always wore sunglasses. After telling him about my travel plans, he was reminiscing 
about the years he spent travelling for work in the oil industry. When I told him I was thinking about 
heading to South America, he mentioned he&apos;d been to Mexico.
“Y&apos;know, back in those days” he said, “you could get a piece of pussy for like, five bucks! These 
days it&apos;d be more like thirty”. He nodded at me solemnly.
This wasn&apos;t the travel advice I&apos;d expected, so I made an expression of concerned sympathy, 
and commented on how nice Oscar&apos;s pizza was.
“Still, it&apos;s way cheaper than marriage” Chris chuckled, picking up a slice of pepperoni.
I decided it was the right time to start clearing up the dishes and carried a stack of plates into the 
kitchen of the Chateau.
The kitchen had a high ceiling, tall windows and exposed beams. In an annex to the side sat a round 
breakfast table with peaches and nectarines piled in the centre. There were no doors to the kitchen, 
so swallows regularly flew in and perched in the beams, cheeping loudly. By the time the dishes were washed, 
most of the guests had gone to bed, so the rest of us sat down for another bottle of wine and enjoyed a 
selection of goats cheeses set out by Oscar; a specialty of the region.
