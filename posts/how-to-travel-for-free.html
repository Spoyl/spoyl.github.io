            This is a guide to modes of travel that enable you to explore the world without having to spend any 
            money (or just a little). I’ve used all these methods with varying degrees of success and will be 
            adding new ones to the list as and when I try them. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks, and 
            it’s rare to find something that doesn’t require anything in return – be prepared to give up some of 
            your time and effort. If you do, you’ll open the door to meaningful connections, unexpected 
            opportunities, new ways of living, and fond memories. <br><br>

        <h4>WorkAway</h4>
        <p class="bodytext">
            Workaway.info is an online tool for connecting people who need workers with people who want to work. 
            But rather than being a job site, WorkAway specifically caters to people looking for cultural exchanges 
            abroad, and the jobs posted there are considered volunteer work. As such, the work is generally unpaid 
            though there are exceptions (you will need to check visa requirements before doing paid work in another 
            country). The types of work are varied, but include; farm stays, gardening, au-pair jobs, language 
            teaching, housesitting, camp hosting and general maintenance. You are usually expected to provide five 
            hours of work a day for five days a week in return for board and lodging. Any more than this is widely 
            considered to be unreasonable, but some hosts will take advantage if you don’t push back. Through the 
            app or the website you can view hosts by region or by the type of work and contact them directly to 
            arrange your visit. There is a fee required to setup an account, but it’s something like £50 for a whole 
            year with no extra costs.

            <h4>WWOOFing</h4>
            <p class="bodytext">
            WWOOFing (WorldWide Opportunities on Organic Farms) is exactly what the acronym suggests; it’s a website where you can connect with organic farmers around the world and offer up your services. Through the website (currently there is no app), you can search for farms by region and specialty to find one that suits your trip. WWOOF is organised by country (there is a WWOOF Spain, WWOOF England, etc) and to use each requires a separate fee of about £50 for one year. However there are currently plans to change this into one unified system. Until then, it’s best used for extended travel in one country. It’s important to note that WOOFing is used primarily for knowledge sharing; hosts expect the workers to be interested in learning about farming methods and ideally to bring some skills or experience with them (don’t let that put you off, everyone has to start somewhere). You’ll be doing a maximum of five hours of work, five days a week in return for accommodation and meals. You can find all sorts of options on the website, including; grape harvesting, wheat growing, bread making, animal care, vegetable farming (the most common), ranch work and eco-construction.

            <h4>Couchsurfing and Too Good to Go</h4>
            <p class="bodytext">
            Couchsurfing is the best option on this list for staying in and around cities. Couchsurfing is an app through which you can find hosts around the world offering up a bed or couch at their home. After paying a small fee for one years membership, you can message anyone on the app to see if they can host you. No catch, just couches. Often, hosts are themselves travellers who have decided to settle down somewhere and want to help out other travellers on their journeys. The added bonus is that you have access to a local who can show you the area. Some hosts might go as far as cooking dinner for you or they may invite you to prepare something in the kitchen, which helps cut down on food expenses. Note however that meals are absolutely not expected from hosts. As such, I’ve bundled this option with Too Good Too Go, an app used by food companies to get rid of meals that haven’t been sold by closing time. You can reserve meals on the app at hugely discounted prices and, depending on how much has been left unsold, the portion sizes are usually generous. Like Couchsurfing, this option is well suited to cities as there are always multiple food vendors to choose from.

            <h4>Meditation Retreats</h4>
            <p class="bodytext">
            Meditation retreats deliver courses in meditation, which generally involve a commitment of about ten days. During that time, the retreat centre will provide you with a bedroom, bathroom and meals for free so long as you commit to the rules of the course. If you feel you gained some benefit from the course, you’re encouraged to donate money or offer up some of your time to help with future retreats – the centres are strictly non-profit. In Dhamma meditation retreats, the rules are strict. For students of the course you are expected to meditate under the teachers instruction for around ten hours a day, every day, starting at four in the morning and finishing at nine in the evening. You’re also required to hand in your phone at the beginning of the course, and students are discouraged from communicating with others. Reading and writing are also discouraged, but no one goes around checking the dorms for books and pens. Serving a course is slightly less intense, with only three hours of mandatory meditation during the day. Most of the work is centred around the kitchen where you will be preparing food for the students. Servers can communicate with each other but you have to sit one course before you can serve.

            <h4>Lean on Your Network (Accommodation)</h4>
            <p class="bodytext">
            This one is obvious but easy to forget. It’s likely that you have a distant family member, ex-colleague, friend or friend-of-a-friend who lives abroad. Simply reaching out to those people to see if they can offer you a spare room or a couch can make for a useful base from which you can explore without any obligations towards your host besides being a good guest (and maybe making some sort of contribution if you’re staying for a long time). Social media platforms will help you here. When you start extending this approach to the network of people you meet on the road, then you’re a real traveller.

            <h4>Hitchhiking</h4>
            <p class="bodytext">
            Hitchhiking is the classic get-around for travellers looking to spend zero cash. The laws vary from country to country, so you’ll need to check online before heading out to the highway. In Canada for example, it’s illegal to hitchhike on major highways for safety reasons, but on-ramps are fair game so long as there isn’t a ‘no walking’ sign. Cultural differences also have a significant impact on your likelihood of actually getting a ride with some places being very open to that sort of thing. Even when cultural and legal conditions are in your favour, don’t expect it to be easy to get a ride. I’ve waited for hours on quiet roads and busy roads alike. Don’t get disheartened – someone will stop. Wherever you go, a good sign is important. Cardboard and sharpie are a tried and tested combination so long as you write in large, clear font. Maybe add a smiley face or a flag from your country of origin to draw interest.

            <h4>Lean on Your Network (Getting Around)</h4>
            <p class="bodytext">
            This appears on the list again, but this time it’s less to do with old friends and family. Instead, the idea is to lean on the network of people you meet on the road. If someone is doing a long trip in the direction you’re heading, more often than not they’ll offer to take you along for free. Again, it’s obvious, but it’s freakishly reliable in some countries – just make your plans known and someone will usually appear who’s going in the same direction.

            <h4>Maps.me</h4>
            <p class="bodytext">
            When travelling, it's nice not to have to pay for network. I've met travellers who go as far as not taking a phone with them on the road, but they seem to spend most of there time asking other travellers to check bus timetables and translations. So, assuming you will bring a smartphone, there are some apps worth considering that eliminate the need for a network connection on the go. Maps.me is an app that replaces google maps by allowing the user to download a set number of maps for offline navigation. They allow nine free region downloads (and you can delete old downloads to replenish your free allowance), which you can do whenever you get a wifi connection. I've used this for getting around mostly in cities in Turkey, and it works super well. Add in Google Translates offline language downloads, and you're pretty well set to wifi hop around the world. The added bonus is that without data, you spend less time scrolling and more time absorbing your travels.
