Personal Website
================

This is my playground on the web, and ongoing quest to develop a some useful tools. I have too many friends working in software development who dedicate their time and effort to using the latest tools and frameworks. I'm convinced that in the longrun this is a bad approach, and learning to do things without prebuilt tools allows you to develop truly novel sites.

The overriding design philosophies are:
- Everything is made exactly how I want it; no concessions to tools, time, or effort :star:
- Prioritise using tools or approaches that increase my options, not restrict them; if no suitable tool exists, I'll build what I need from scratch :construction_worker:
- Every feature of the site must have real value; ignore technical curiosities :leaves:

Milestones so Far
-----------------

1. Site designed in Figma (icons and svgs made using inkscape) :tada:
2. Static site built using only JS, CSS and HTML :tada:
3. WIP; Custom Python site builder added to speed up my workflows :construction:

Future Plans
------------
- Custom ML tools that run in the browser
