            I arrived at my first farm in the late afternoon on Monday the 5th June 2023. It was an indecisive 
            day in France, with the weather alternating between humid and bucketing with rain. My host farmer 
            (l&apos;agriculteur) was a rural-looking French man named Marcel, who collected me in an old Renault 
            from the train station at Vierzon. The farm was small but well-equipped for rearing livestock, 
            which was the main purpose of the enterprise. There were about three barns and a couple of old 
            houses for the farmer and his family; his parents lived on the farm also. On arrival, I was greeted 
            by Gershwin, a friendly Colly-cross who I later discovered had fleas (des Puces), and shown into the 
            main house. Another farmer, Marcell&apos;s partner Francoise, was inside and greeted me warmly. At this 
            point, I was using my very limited French to make small talk and show them that I meant no harm, taking 
            comfort in the understanding that Marcel had stated online that both English and French were spoken on 
            the farm.<br/><br/>
            Shortly after dropping off my bag in a big bedroom, I was asked to come along to the evening feeding of 
            the animals (les bestiaux) to get an idea of what I would be helping with in the coming days. We three, 
            with Gershwin in tow, walked together to one of the barns and entered under an extended roof. An 
            analogue radio perched high by the entrance played classical music which was quickly drowned out by the 
            sound of thirty loud pigs recognising that dinner time had come. (If you haven&apos;t heard a pig scream 
            before, think Nazgûl from the Lord of the Rings. Theyl&apos;re big, too, the adults are easily twice the 
            weight of an adult man). The pigs were housed in six separate pens ranging from the youngest group 
            through to the eldest who would soon be ready for slaughter. Francoise and Marcel got to work clearing 
            out the troughs, filling buckets (les seaux) with a mixture of ground wheat and beans, and dispensing 
            the melange past the waiting snouts and into the troughs. This was followed by buckets of water to wash 
            everything down.<br/><br/>
            Next the goats. The goats were a calm bunch, clearly excited about dinner but not as inclined to make a 
            scene. Hay (soin) was spread out for them in front of a fence-like structure with space for each goat to 
            insert her head. The type of hay that was given was different according to the time of day, with the least 
            nutritious in the morning and the most nutritious in the evening. As they ate, I helped give bottled cows 
            milk to the youngest goats (les chevreau) who needed extra to support their growth. Meanwhile Marcel had 
            been feeding the cows who now needed to be herded to a small plot next door where they would sleep.<br/>
            <br/>
            Herding the cows was an event that happened four times a day between three sites. It involved following 
            the cows with small lengths of stiff hosepipe and whacking them if they slowed or veered 
            off course. The cows seemed perfectly content to just walk slowly to the field, but moving them along was 
            performing art for Marcel. A whirlwind of disappointment, frustration and incomprehension met each cow that 
            didn&apos;t meet the required pace. This was hilarious and slightly disturbing to watch since he seemed 
            genuinely distressed.

            During the first evening, there happened to be a documentary playing at a nearby cinema about an ongoing 
            (at the time of writing) issue happening in France. A few &apos;Mega-bassines, huge overground 
            reservoirs, had been built in the West of France, and more had been proposed. These were intended to supply 
            water to a small number of large, industrial farms during summer by pumping ground water in the winter 
            when the water table was high. The catch was that these reservoirs disrupted the water supply to smaller 
            farmers and caused widespread damage to ecosystems. <br/><br/>
            We attended this viewing, after which the makers of the documentary lined up in front of the audience and a 
            debate began with a moderator handing around a microphone. The audience was clearly split with people 
            arguing both sides, but I was struck by how respectful the general tone was despite the disagreement. This 
            continued until we left at midnight.

            The next day, after the animals had had their breakfast, I helped Francoise and the butcher in the 
            laboratoire to make sausages and chipolatas from a recently demised pig. This involved mincing up the 
            offcuts then pumping them into a tube of pig intestine. The kit used for this was old and of questionable 
            cleanliness, as were the surfaces, but it was satisfying to finish up for lunch having produced a tangible 
            output.<br/><br/>
            Lunch in France is a bigger affair than in England, usually consisting of multiple courses; three or four 
            as standard. Generally, you begin with a starter, like bread, then move onto a main, followed by dessert 
            and then a cheese board. Over lunch, I attempted to practice my French by making conversation with my hosts. 
            Increasingly though, it was becoming clear that my hosts spoke no English except for the occasional “take” 
            or “good”, pronounced “tek” and “gooda”. This became even more apparent after I tried to help out with 
            feeding the animals in the evening. The problem was that many different things had to be done and I was 
            being told what to do on the fly in French. This is a pretty high stakes way to learn a language that 
            required lots of gesticulating and which often fails to convey the nuance of “give the goats enough of the 
            truffle infused hay”.<br/><br/>
            The tension grew over the following days until it began to feel openly hostile. On Thursday I was ill (un 
            nez qui coule) and the washing machine had broken. Marcel floated past my window in a tractor, absentmindedly 
            picking his nose. I made the decision to find somewhere else asap, and sent out several messages to different 
            hosts online. On Friday, I heard back from a couple nearby who needed help with the grounds of a chateau, 
            which sounded great. The next day I packed my bags, said a very awkward goodbye to Francoise and hopped on 
            a train to the medieval French town of Chinon, Loire Valley.
